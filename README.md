# GTD System - Getting Things Done

## Overview

**Getting Things Done (GTD)** is a time management and productivity methodology created by David Allen. The core idea of GTD is to move tasks out of your mind and into an external system that allows you to prioritize and manage them efficiently. This system emphasizes capturing all your tasks, breaking them down into actionable steps, and organizing them in a way that ensures nothing slips through the cracks. The result is a clear mind, enabling you to focus on the tasks at hand without worrying about forgetting important details.

## Project Description

This project aims to build a **GTD System** using **Node.js** as the backend and **Angular** as the frontend. The goal is to develop a web-based application that allows users to manage their tasks, projects, and overall productivity following the GTD methodology. The application will support features such as task creation, project management, due dates, prioritization, and context tagging. Additionally, it will provide user authentication to ensure that each user's data is secure and personalized.

### Key Features
- **Task Management**: Create, update, and delete tasks with descriptions, due dates, priorities, and completion status.
- **Projects and Contexts**: Group tasks into projects and tag them with contexts to better organize and prioritize work.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and registration with JWT-based authentication.
- **Responsive UI**: A user-friendly interface built with Angular that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Reminders and Notifications**: Set reminders for tasks to ensure nothing is overlooked.

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Frontend**: Angular for building a dynamic and responsive user interface
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing tasks, projects, and user information
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user sessions
- **Real-Time Features**: Ajax for real-time task updates (future enhancement)
